# FUTURE_DS_03
# 🎓 Event Feedback Analysis – Data Science Internship Task 3

This project analyzes student feedback collected from college events like workshops, seminars, and lectures to extract meaningful insights using basic data science techniques. It is part of a virtual internship program by **Future Interns**.

---

## 📊 Overview

Student feedback data includes ratings on various aspects like subject clarity, presentations, course structure, and assignment difficulty. The aim is to:

- Understand overall satisfaction
- Identify top-performing aspects
- Suggest actionable improvements for future events

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

| Tool          | Purpose                            |
|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| Python (Google Colab) | Coding environment (no installation needed) |
| pandas        | Data handling and analysis         |
| seaborn/matplotlib | Data visualization            |
| TextBlob *(optional)* | Sentiment analysis (skipped due to no feedback column) |

## 📁 Dataset

- Format: CSV
- Sample fields: `Student_ID`, `Well_versed_with_the_subject`, `Use_of_presentations`, `Degree_of_difficulty_of_assignments`, etc.
- Feedback is based on a **1–10 scale**

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Highest-rated aspect**: `Well_versed_with_the_subject` — shows the content delivery was strong.
- **Lowest-rated aspect**: `Degree_of_difficulty_of_assignments` — could be simplified or better explained.
- **Overall sentiment**: Mostly positive; average scores are in the higher range (6–8).
- **Course Structure**: Well-structured and highly recommended by students.

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- Provide **walkthroughs for complex assignments**
- Retain strong **subject clarity & presentations**
- Introduce **small-group support** for advanced learners

## 📌 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload the `student_feedback.csv` file
3. Run each cell step-by-step to see analysis
4. View charts and read final insights in the notebook

---

## 📈 Final Output

- 📊 Bar chart of average scores by category
- ✅ Cleaned dataset
- 📝 Text-based summary and recommendations

---

## 📁 Deliverables

- `Event_Feedback_Analysis.ipynb` – analysis notebook
- `student_feedback.csv` – input data
